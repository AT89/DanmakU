{"name":"DanmakU","tagline":"An open source Danmaku development kit for Unity.","body":"# DanmakU\r\nDanmakU is an open source danmaku development kit for Unity3D.\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\nSee the [wiki](https://github.com/rhythmia/DanmakU/wiki) on a number of tutorials on how to get started.  \r\nSee the [script documentation](http://rhythmia.org/DanmakU/Docs/html/annotated.html) to see a scripting reference.\r\n\r\n# Structure\r\nDanmakU is split into multiple packages which can be used seperately or together depending on your needs:\r\n* Core - The central core to the entire dev kit, requires UnityUtilLib, Vexe Framework, and Unity3D itself.\r\n* Touhou - A specialized package for single player danmaku games with many of the same mechanics as many of the mainline Touhou games, **Requires: Core**\r\n* Phantasmagoria - A specialized package for multiplayer versus danmaku games similar to Touhou Kaeidzuka ~ Phantasmagoria of Flower View and Touhou 3 - Touhou Yumejikuu ~ Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream, **Requires: Core**\r\n\r\n# Dependencies\r\nThis development kit relies heavily on [UnityUtilLib](https://github.com/james7132/UnityUtilLib), a utility library.\r\n\r\nAll releases of DanmakU, including the source code releases, come packaged with the version of UnityUtilLib that is used.\r\n\r\nIt is also being tested with [Vexe Framework](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/free-vfw-full-set-of-drawers-savesystem-serialize-interfaces-generics-auto-props-delegates.266165/) as a way to serialize a number of objects that are not currently easily serialized by Unity.\r\n\r\n#Installation\r\n\r\nTo get DanmakU running in your Unity project, follow these instructions:\r\n\r\n1. Go to the releases page for this repository ([link](https://github.com/Rhythmia/DanmakU/releases)) and find the appropriate release version (usually this is the latest release that is for your version of Unity).\r\n2. Download the attached .unitypackage binary.\r\n3. In Unity, open the project you wish to use the development kit with.\r\n4. In the menu at the top, click Assets > Import Package > Custom Package.\r\n5. Navigate to where you downloaded the unitypackage to and open it.\r\n6. It will then prompt you which assets to add. Select all of them, and click Import.\r\n7. Restart Unity. (this refreshes Unity, and pulls up all of the Unity Editor extensions created for this dev kit).\r\n\r\n#Source Code Installation/Setup\r\n\r\nTo get the source code up and running, execute the following command in your command line:\r\n\r\n    git clone --recursive https://github.com/Rhythmia/DanmakU.git\r\n    \r\nNote: the \"--recursive\" parameter is required to successfully clone the right UnityUtilLib version. \r\n\r\nFor older clones or git versions older than 1.6.5, use the following commands.\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/Rhythmia/DanmakU.git\r\n    cd DanmakU\r\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\r\n","google":"UA-61901276-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
