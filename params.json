{"name":"DanmakuUnity2D","tagline":"An open source Danmaku development kit for Unity.","body":"# DanmakuUnity2D\r\nDanmakuUnity2D is a lightweight open source development kit for Unity intended to create 2D Danmaku, or bullet hell, games.\r\n\r\nLargely inspired by Touhou and Touhou Danmakufu. Many of the functions mirror that of many available in Danmakufu.\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\nSee the [wiki](https://github.com/james7132/DanmakuUnity2D/wiki) on a number of tutorials on how to get started.  \r\nSee the [script documentation](http://james7132.github.io/DanmakuUnity2D/Docs/html/annotated.html) to see a scripting reference.\r\n\r\n# Dependencies\r\nThis development kit relies heavily on [UnityUtilLib](https://github.com/james7132/UnityUtilLib), a utility library.\r\n\r\nAll releases of DanmakuUnity2D, including the source code releases, come packaged with the version of UnityUtilLib that is used.\r\n\r\nIt is also being tested with [Vexe Framework](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/free-vfw-full-set-of-drawers-savesystem-serialize-interfaces-generics-auto-props-delegates.266165/) as a way to serialize a number of objects that are not currently easily serialized by Unity.\r\n\r\n#Installation\r\n\r\nTo get DanmakuUnity2D running in your Unity project, follow these instructions:\r\n\r\n1. Go to the releases page for this repository ([link](https://github.com/james7132/DanmakuUnity2D/releases)) and find the appropriate release version (usually this is the latest release that is for your version of Unity).\r\n2. Download the attached .unitypackage binary.\r\n3. In Unity, open the project you wish to use the development kit with.\r\n4. In the menu at the top, click Assets > Import Package > Custom Package.\r\n5. Navigate to where you downloaded the unitypackage to and open it.\r\n6. It will then prompt you which assets to add. Select all of them, and click Import.\r\n7. Restart Unity. (this refreshes Unity, and pulls up all of the Unity Editor extensions created for this dev kit).\r\n\r\n#Source Code Installation/Setup\r\n\r\nTo get the source code up and running, execute the following command in your command line:\r\n\r\n    git clone --recursive https://github.com/james7132/DanmakuUnity2D.git\r\n    \r\nNote: the \"--recursive\" parameter is required to successfully clone the right UnityUtilLib version. \r\n\r\nFor older clones or git versions older than 1.6.5, use the following commands.\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/james7132/DanmakuUnity2D.git\r\n    cd DanmakuUnity2D\r\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\r\n","google":"UA-61901276-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
